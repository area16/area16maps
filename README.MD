 # Area 16 Maps

This repo captures work done to capture district / zone boundaries in Area 16. Because it's a painful, laborious process, source files are stored here for future manipulation and use.

## How to use

These SVGs were built using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.3.2/), a free open source SVG / Vector tool. It's available on all major computer platforms. When you open the SVG, you'll need to reveal the layers you want to show or edit, and then export a PNG or other formats you'd like.
